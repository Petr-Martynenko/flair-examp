I tried computing and using USRBIN card to obtain the energy deposited in the detector
1) Energy deposited (energy deposited whole, Gev/cm3)
2) Dose and 
3) the calculation of Dose-Equivalent using USRBIN and AUXSCORE. 
The results from USRBIN are normalised per unit volume and per unit primary weight
I try to calculate the differential yield in energy and polar angle in order to obtain the yield 

I would like to get the number of neutrons which are generated in the detector after irradiation by proton ions
