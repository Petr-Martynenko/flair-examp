I tried computing and using USRBIN card to obtain the energy deposited in the detector
1) Energy deposited (energy deposited whole, Gev/cm3)
2) Dose! I score the dose in GeV/g per primary and then transform it in Sv/h per primary.
3) the calculation of Dose-Equivalent (Sv per primary) using USRBIN and AUXSCORE 
The results from USRBIN are normalised per unit volume and per unit primary weight

I try to calculate the differential yield in energy and polar angle in order to obtain the yield 

I would like to get the number of neutrons which are generated in the detector after irradiation by proton ions
I use USRBDX card to score the energy spectrum of Î± and Li, but unfortunately I get nothing
